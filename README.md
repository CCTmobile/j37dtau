## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
3. Set up environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables))
4. Set up Supabase (see [Supabase Setup](#supabase-setup))
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Supabase Setup

### Creating a Supabase Project

1. Sign up or log in at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Note your project URL and anon key (found in Project Settings > API)
4. Set up environment variables with these values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables))

### Database Setup

The application uses Supabase as its backend database. To set up the database schema:

1. Navigate to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Run the migration scripts located in the `supabase/migrations` directory in sequence:
   - `20240626000000_initial_schema.sql` - Creates the base tables and relationships
   - `20240626000001_sample_data.sql` - Adds sample data (optional for development)
   - `20240626000002_functions.sql` - Adds database functions and triggers

Alternatively, you can use the Supabase CLI to run migrations:

```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref your-project-id
supabase db push
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

Replace `your-project-id` and `your-anon-key` with your actual Supabase project values.

For detailed instructions, see the [Environment Setup Guide](./docs/environment-setup.md).

## Database Migrations

Database migrations are stored in the `supabase/migrations` directory. These SQL files define the database schema, relationships, and initial data.

When making changes to the database schema:

1. Create a new migration file with a timestamp prefix
2. Add your SQL commands to the file
3. Run the migration manually or using the Supabase CLI

## Admin Setup

The application includes an admin dashboard for managing products, orders, and users.

### Default Admin Account

The migration scripts create a default admin user:
- Email: admin@rosemama.com
- Role: admin

You'll need to set up a password for this account through the Supabase Authentication system.

For detailed instructions on admin functionality, see:
- [Admin Setup Guide](./docs/admin-setup.md)
- [Admin Role Management](./docs/admin-role-management.md)

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
